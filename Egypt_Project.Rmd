# Project Description
*As explained on telephone, I send to you this email to inform about some of the business opportunities in Egypt.*

*The Egyptian government had formed a special authority who's entrusted with reviving and refreshing the slow and old fashion performance of state owned enterprises in several sectors.*

*The intention is to invite capable international entities with advanved tecnology and know-how to takeover these businesses for the purpose to invest into revamping, modifying, modernizing, and operate for a reasonable term that assures good return on such investment.*

*The specific role of the interested international investors depends on the investment opportunity and the sector belonging to it.*

*In our case, for the hospitality sector, it has been described as follows:*

- The company also possesses knowledge of local market needs, as well as capabilities to suggest project ideas and draft preliminary feasibility studies about the kinds of projects that can be implemented (Such as a Conferenc Center in Luxor).

**Business Opportunity**

- Equity Partner for a potential SPV with the mandate of establishing touristic property according to market needs & trends, is needed.
- The targeted partner should have track record and rich experience in developing and potentially managing hospitality entities (hotels, conference centers, commercial areas, Garages... etc.)

*Examples are the three development areas as attached and listed below:*
